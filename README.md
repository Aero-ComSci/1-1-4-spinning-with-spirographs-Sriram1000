**Zero-iteration conditions and infinite loops**

Zero-iteration conditions are the complete opposite of Infinite loops. Infinite loops iterate forever, while zero-iteration conditions donâ€™t even iterate once.

**Question 21**

Answer: This flow chart represents avoiding a zero-iteration loop. If your answer is equal to "y", the algorithm continues, but if it isn't, then it ends.

**Undecidable Code**

This shows that the code is undecidable as no algorithm can determine it. It'll loop forever but everytime it loops it passes.
