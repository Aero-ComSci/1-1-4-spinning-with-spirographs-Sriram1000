**Zero-iteration conditions and infinite loops**
Zero-iteration conditions are the complete opposite of Infinite loops. Infinite loops iterate forever, while zero-iteration conditions don’t even iterate once. 

Zero-iteration example:
x = 5

while x==8:
	print(“I hate the AI Club!”)
	
	Here's what comes out:



	[nothing]




Infinite Loop example:
x = 5

while x == 5:
	print(“I love the AI Club!”)

	Here's what comes out:

	“I love the AI Club!”
	“I love the AI Club!”
	“I love the AI Club!”
	“I love the AI Club!” * ∞


**Question 21**

This flow chart represents avoiding a zero-iteration loop. If your answer is equal to "y", the algorithm continues, but if it isn't, then it ends.

**Undecidable Code**

This shows that the code is undecidable as no algorithm can determine it. It'll loop forever but everytime it loops it passes.
